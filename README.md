# ShoppingCart

## About the Project
This program creates a simulation of a shopping cart where the user can add items to the cart, see the total price of all the items, and restock the items using a strapi API. This is a practice activity for MITx Pro's Web Development Class.

## How to Run
This program uses react, so it must be run on a local server, and the API requires a local server to run as well.  

## What's Next
In the future, I would like to improve the user experience of this progrma more. I would like to display the stock and have it change as the user adds and removes products from the cart. I would also like to update information in the API from the webpage, and have the initial array of products load from the api instead of loading from a pre-written array.
